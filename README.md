This is a basic C++ program.

The objective of this program is to get a clear idea and form a database about the number of people who look up cars and the types of cars that they search for, while usually, people prefer to look at cars in person, due to the pandemic, it's become much easier to search for cars online, and cars have become more necessary for transport due to their better, safer environment of transport.

The program identifies the type of car the user wants, asking several questions about their transmission type, preferred fuel, and seating capacity, and then quickly searches for the type of car that most match the given prompts, it also has health-based searches to cope with current times.

The program then stores the types of prompts and all the searches onto a database, simplifying it and making it easier to find out, it also saves popular combinations of searches and the number of people searching for said combinations and then provides them to the admin when asked for, which can be used to see the most popular kind of vehicles and recommend them to more people.
